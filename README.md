# Emailsorter
This is a python program that sorts emails according to a specific keyword in the Subject("Thank you for applying")
It's a pretty simple program that uses Imaplib and email libraries to connect to your gmail id and then scrapes the emails in your inbox and searches for subject with matching keyword
